# BLIND IMAGE QUALITY TOOLBOX
This project is a collection of algorithms for Blind Image Quality assessment in Matlab.

## Hint:
- IQVG requires some Libsvm-Mex files which are available here: https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/tree/master
  Don't forget to add the library to the path (see computeQualityMetrics.m)
- DIIVINE requires a special version of Matlab which is available here: https://github.com/gregfreeman/libsvm/tree/new_matlab_interface
  Don't forget to add the library to the path (see computeQualityMetrics.m)
- Depending on your environment setup it might be necessary to modify the path to all libsvm executables (see IQVG.m, brisquescore.m)
