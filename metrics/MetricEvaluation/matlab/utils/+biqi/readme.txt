========================================================================

This is a demonstration of the Blind Image Quality Index (BIQI).
It is an implementation of the BIQI in the reference.
The algorithm is described in:
A. K. Moorthy and A. C. Bovik, "A Modular Framework for Constructing Blind
Universal Quality Indices", submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters (2009).

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/biqi.zip).

Input : A test 8bits/pixel grayscale image loaded in a 2-D array
Output: A quality score of the image. The score typically has a value
       between 0 and 100 (0 represents the best quality, 100 the worst).

Usage:

1. Load the image, for example

  image = rgb2gray(imread('testimage.jpg')); 

2. Call this function to calculate the quality score:

   quality = biqi(image)

Dependencies:
MATLAB Wavelet  Toolbox
You may need the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
Binaries: svm-train, svm-scale (from LibSVM) - provided with release
Other m files: jpeg_quality_score.m (provided with release)
Data files: range2, range2_wn, range2_blur, range2_jp2k, model_89,
model_89_wn, model_89_blur, model_89_jp2k, range2_ff, model_89_ff (provided with release)
========================================================================

Note on training: 
This release version of BIQI was trained on the entire LIVE database.


This program uses LibSVM binaries.
Below is the requried copyright notice for the binaries distributed with this release.

====================================================================
LibSVM tools: svm-predict, svm-scale (binaries)
