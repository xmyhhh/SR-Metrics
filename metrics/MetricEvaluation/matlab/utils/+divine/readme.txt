========================================================================

This is a demonstration of the Distortion Identification based image Verity and INtegrity Evaluation (DIVINE) index.
It is an implementation of the BIQI in the reference.
The algorithm is described in:
A. K. Moorthy and A. C. Bovik, "Blind Image Quality Assessment: From Natural
Scene Statistics to Perceptual Quality",  IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, to appear (2011).

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/DIIVINE_release.zip).

Input : A test 8bits/pixel grayscale image loaded in a 2-D array
Output: A quality score of the image. The score typically has a value
       between 0 and 100 (0 represents the best quality, 100 the worst).

Usage:

1. Load the image, for example

  image = rgb2gray(imread('testimage.jpg')); 

2. Call this function to calculate the quality score:

   quality = divine(image)

Dependencies: 
Steerable Pyramid Toolbox, Download from: http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/steerpyr/
LibSVM package for MATLAB, Download from: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
You may need the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox

Dependencies--

MATLAB files:  ssim_index_new.m, norm_sender_normalized.m, find_spatial_hist_fast.m, divine_overall_quality.m
              divine_feature_extract.m,  map_matrix_to_closest_vec.m (provided with release)

Data files: data_live_trained.mat (provided with release)

This code has been tested on Windows and Mac OSX (Snow Leopard)

========================================================================

Note on training: 
This release version of BIQI was trained on the entire LIVE database.
